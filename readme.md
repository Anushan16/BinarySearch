This is a algorithim to conduct a binary search for Leetcode excercise 704.

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, this function searches for the target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, it returns "not found".

This algo consists of a  O(log n) runtime complexity.
